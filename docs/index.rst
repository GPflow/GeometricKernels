Overview
========

Geometric Kernels is a library that implements natural kernels (Heat, Mat√©rn) on such non-Euclidean spaces as **Riemannian manifolds** or **graphs**.

The main projected application is within the Gaussian process framework.
Some of the features are specifically inspired by it, most notably by the problem of efficient sampling.

Installation and Requirements
=============================

This is a **Python 3** library.
To install Geometric Kernels, run

.. code::

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/GPflow/GeometricKernels.git

The kernels are compatible with several backends:

- `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ (can be used together with the GP library `GPflow <https://github.com/GPflow/GPflow>`_),
- `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ (can be used together with the GP library `GPyTorch <https://gpytorch.ai/>`_),
- `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_,
- `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax/>`_.

A Basic Example
===============

In the following example we show how to initialize the Matern52 kernel on the two-dimensional sphere and how to compute a kernel matrix for a vector of random points on the sphere.

.. doctest:: python

   >>> # Import a backend.
   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> # Import the geometric_kernels backend.
   >>> import geometric_kernels
   >>> # Import a space and an appropriate kernel.
   >>> from geometric_kernels.spaces.hypersphere import Hypersphere
   >>> from geometric_kernels.kernels.geometric_kernels import MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel

   >>> # Create a manifold (2-dim sphere).
   >>> hypersphere = Hypersphere(dim=2)

   >>> # Generate 3 random points on the sphere.
   >>> xs = np.array([[0., 0., 1.], [0., 1., 0.], [1., 0., 0.]])

   >>> # Initialize kernel, use 100 terms to approximate the infinite series.
   >>> kernel = MaternKarhunenLoeveKernel(hypersphere, 100)
   >>> params, state = kernel.init_params_and_state()
   >>> params["nu"] = np.array([5/2])
   >>> params["lengthscale"] = np.array([1.])

   >>> # Compute and print out the 3x3 kernel matrix.
   >>> print(kernel.K(params, state, xs))
   [[0.00855354 0.00305004 0.00305004]
    [0.00305004 0.00855354 0.00305004]
    [0.00305004 0.00305004 0.00855354]]


We used NumPy above. To use other backends (PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX), the line

.. code::

   import geometric_kernels

should be changed into the line

.. code::

   import geometric_kernels.<backend>

where :code:`<backend>` may be one of :code:`torch`, :code:`tensorflow` or :code:`jax`.
Of course, the relevant type of tensors should be used instead of :code:`np.array` as well.
